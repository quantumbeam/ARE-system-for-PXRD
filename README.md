## Repository Contents

This repository includes the following:

1. **Rietveld Analysis Results**: Detailed results from our quantitative XRD analysis using the BBO-Rietveld method.

2. **BBO-Rietveld Script**: Basic implementation of our BBO-Rietveld method for automated XRD data analysis.

    The detailed implementation of the BBO-Rietveld method can be found in a separate repository: https://github.com/quantumbeam/BBO-Rietveld

    For a comprehensive understanding of the BBO-Rietveld method and its full implementation, please refer to the linked repository.

3. **CAD Files**: 3D models of the custom-designed end effector used in our robotic system.
